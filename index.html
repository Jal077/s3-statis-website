      <h3>1.1 Data Collection of Monitored Containers</h3>
      In this section, the process of run-time metrics resources of OpenFaaS functions are collected using the Docker API command named as docker stats. Further, these metrics are collected to a file named docker-metrics in which the data is again filtered and rounded up to the integer value.
      The resources consumed by the functions are stored as a total percent used. Further, these values are passed as an argument to the controller module and based on these values further analyzing is performed which is explained in the next section.
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4>1.2 Analyzing the Collected Data </h4>
      Once the resource arguments are received by the controller module, they are sent to perform optimization analysis. First, the controller optimizes the CPU-shares of an OpenFaaS function. If the passed arguments that is the CPU percentage are more than 50 percent then the CPU controller will allocate 1030 of CPU-shares to the function which corresponds to the 1 CPU core. However, if the CPU percentage is less than 50 percent than it will allocate 512 CPU-shares that correspond to the half CPU core. Once CPU resource optimization is done, next comes the memory usage. If the memory utilization is less than or equal to thresholds configured in the memory segment of the controller than allocate the memory based on the memory limits specified in the controller. Next, the block I/O section is considered, for optimising the block I/O resource. Based on the blocks consumed by the OpenFaaS functions and the thresholds set for blocks the blockio-weight is allocated to the function container.
      <br>
      <br>
      <h5>1.3 Dynamically Allocating the Optimised Resources</h5>
      This section illustrates the dynamic allocation of the optimised values which are analyzed in the above section. The optimised values are stored in a python variable and using the docker update Docker API command the optimised resources are allocated to the OpenFaaS functions. Next, once these resources are allocated to the container, then the next phase comprises of the optimized module which is responsible for again invoking the function and analyzing how much resource are now unused and how much is the resource utilization in percent and MB. Next, the prediction phase comes into picture where the collector is responsible again for fetching up the monitored data and generating a CSV files for each resource, which is discussed in next section.
      <br>
      <br>
      <h6>1.4 Resource Prediction using ARIMA</h6>
      In this section, the prediction for future resource consumption is predicted using the ARIMA model. For executing the ARIMA model, the Jupyter notebook is implemented in which Python 3 language is used. Further, the CSV files which are generated by the collector module is configured in the Jupyter notebook for each resource. The CSV file contains the time-series analysis data which are in comma-separated and resource utilized in percentage. The library which are used for predicting the values are tsa plots, pandas, and ARIMA. After forecasting the predicted resources they are sent to the AWS CloudWatch Dashboard as an expected future resource for serverless functions.
